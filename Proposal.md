## Overview
The advent of [digital audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio) is as consequential a development in music as the adoption of [staff notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_notation). Despite this, university music education lacks robust curriculum in this area, and where it exists, it is generally limited to [synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer) techniques. The author of this document argues that curriculum in digital audio should be considered an integral part of music education at the university level, and proposes a framework for conferring both conceptual understanding and technical skills in this area. 

## Methods
The form of this project will be a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file, like the one you are currently reading. The Markdown format is extremely common in the world of software development, and can be directly deployed as a webpage using free, open-source tools like [Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)). 

Deploying research and curriculum as public webpages democratizes knowledge in accordance with the principles of [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access), as juxtaposed with gatekept research databases such as [JSTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSTOR).

The document will critique contemporary music academia and propose alternative/supplementary curriculum, with emphasis on ways in which electronic techniques break traditional Western models of music. The author will demonstrate the ways in which an understanding of digital audio both encompasses and transcends prior methods of musical analysis. 

Musical examples paired with mathematical analysis will be used to illustrate these points. For example, a chord stacked (bass to treble) C-F-C may traditionally be understood as an F5 in second inversion, but this voicing processed with sufficient saturation will produce an F an octave lower than the one sounded, putting the chord in root position. 

## Deliverables Timeline
