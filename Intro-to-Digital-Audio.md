# Intro to Digital Audio

What is audio? Moreover, what is sound? These are important questions to ask and answer if you study music.

**Music** is often defined as ordered **sound**, sound being perceivable changes in air pressure. When these changes occur with periodicity at rates between 20 and 20,000 cycles per second (Hertz | Hz), they are perceived as **pitch**. When they occur slower, they are perceived as **rhythm**, and are imperceivable when faster than ~20kHz.  

**Audio** is an abstraction of sound. Where sound describes changes in air pressure over time, audio describes the change of an arbitrary value (known as **amplitude**) over time, particularly changes in the **audio band** of 0Hz-20kHz. Audio allows for high-resolution representation of music in mediums other than sound, which allows for the **recording and playback** of music.

Since the dawn of the 21st century, **digital computers** have been the standard tool for composition, recording, processing, and playback- nearly all music is touched by computers in some way. 

Despite this, curriculum in digital audio is underdeveloped in many university and high school music programs.
